1. Introduction

The Solar System 3D Visualization project, created by Siddharth, is an interactive application designed to make learning about space fun and engaging.
Developed using the Three.js library, it allows users to explore the Solar System in a 3D environment.

You can observe:

Planetary rotations on their own axis

Revolutions around the Sun

The beauty of cosmic space in an educational and immersive way

2. Project Overview

The project includes:

An HTML file that sets up the webpage and loads required libraries

A main JavaScript file, solarSystem.js, which creates the 3D scene, applies planet textures, and handles animation + user interactivity

Together, these bring the Solar System to life in your browser.

3. Features
